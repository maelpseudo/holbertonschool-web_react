# Task 5. Animation

In this you’ll apply a tailwind bounce animation in the notifications title Your notifications

The condition is simple, in the `Notifications.jsx`:

Whenever the notifications prop array length is > 0 AND the displayDrawer prop is set to `false` then add the bounce animation
otherwise no bounce animation applied
Consider how to conditionally apply CSS classes in React based on prop values

**Requirements:**
* Your final UI should be the same as shown in the screenshots
* Don’t remove any existing classes or ids
* You’re not allowed to create any TailwindCSS configuration file
* No CSS file import statement in all components
* No `*.css` files allowed (except for the main.css that’s already provided)
