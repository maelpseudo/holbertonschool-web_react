# React Hooks
## Resources
* Import React Simplified
* React Hooks Docs
* Why react doesn’t update state immediately
* State mutation
* Rules of Hooks
* React memo
* useCallback-use case
* use-effect
* useReducer

## Learning objectives
* Understanding the transition from class to functional components and maintain same functionality while modernizing code
* Learning different React hooks (useState, useContext, useEffect…)
* Understanding component optimization
* Understanding and build custom React hooks
* Developing testing strategies for hooks
* Understanding reducer pattern before Redux

## Requirements
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node 20.x.x and npm 10.x.x
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
* Import React only in the main.jsx file, and avoid importing it in individual component files.
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the project’s folder and each task’s folder, is mandatory
* Install Jest globally: npm install -g jest

## Common React Hooks
Common React Hooks:
1. useState - Manages component state
```
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
2. useEffect - Handles side effects (lifecycle methods)
```
useEffect(() => { /* code */ }, [dependencies]);
```
3. useContext - Consumes context (used in Header)
```
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```
4. useRef - Creates mutable refs
```
const inputRef = useRef(null);
```
5. useCallback - Memoizes functions
```
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { /* code */ }, [deps]);
```
6. useMemo - Memoizes values
```
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensive(), [deps]);
```
7. useReducer - Alternative to useState for complex state
```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```
